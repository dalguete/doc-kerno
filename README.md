Doc-Kerno
=========

Helpers used to create a new Project env, about anything, that uses Docker as its kernel.


Why the name
------------

It's a mix between Docker and Kerno. Docker, you know what it is, and Kerno is a new thing I have in mind that focuses the entire process of anything around a single concept, a kernel (you'll know more about this soonish). 

With this, I imply Docker is revolving as a main part, a kernel. Kerno is just the Esperanto translation of Core. More on this in **Kerno Project (https://github.com/dalguete/kerno)**.

How to use it
-------------

Just run the command with the correct options set
